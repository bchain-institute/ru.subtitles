1
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,020
So, we're standing here in my living room

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,269
in Tokyo, Japan.  And I'm going to show 

3
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,759
everybody just how amazing Bitcoin is by

4
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,679
sending a hundred euros worth of Bitcoin

5
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,699
as of today's value through my TV onto

6
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,829
the camera onto the TV in the

7
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:32,329
Netherlands and anybody with their

8
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,280
Bitcoin wallet ready that scans what

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,420
they're going to see on the screen in a

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,280
moment.  We'll be able to claim the 100

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,960
euros worth of Bitcoins and there's

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,579
nothing that anybody can do to stop it

13
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,410
or to freeze your account or block it or

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,719
control it in any way.  So, on the TV here,

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,280
we have a Bitcoin address that I've just

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,859
generated.  And I have my phone here.  I'm

17
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,420
going to scan the QR code for the

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,000
Bitcoin address on the TV. Now I have it. 

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,010
I'm going to send 100 euros worth of

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,780

Bitcoins to that address.  So, we'll hit send

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,449

and anybody can monitor on Blockchain.info 

22
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,550
the balance of this address.  There

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,829
it is. 100 euros worth of Bitcoins just

24
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,239
arrived at this address.  So, total 

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,120
received 100 euros; final balance, 100

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,520
euros, just like that.  So on this next

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,290
screen you're about to see anybody with

28
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,480
their Bitcoin wallet that scans the

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,310
private key that corresponds with that

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,830
address will be able to claim that

31
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,660
money just by scanning the code that

32
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,710
you're about to see on your television.

33
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,960
So, if you want to take a look, here it 

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,850
comes, 100 euros ready for anyone to 

35
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,100
claim.  All you have to do is scan this

36
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,190
one right here.  And it's 100 euros

37
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,080
worth of Bitcoins as of today.  By the

38
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,760
time you scan it, it might be worth even 

39
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,090
more.

40
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,370
So, there it is for anyone ready to claim

41
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,229
with their Bitcoin wallet.

42
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,990
Okay, Holland, now you've just seen the

43
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,479
power of Bitcoin.  I sent 100 euros

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,189
worth of Bitcoin from here in Tokyo 

45
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,079
directly to you guys through this camera,

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,450
through the network, through the TV right

47
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,640
into your home.  If I had tried to do that —

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,289
send you the money with a traditional

49
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,179
bank, it would have taken several days

50
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:58,909
and probably cost 30 euros.  I just did it

51
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,950
right now with Bitcoin instantly,

52
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,590
basically, for free and didn't have to

53
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,509
ask anybody for permission.  I didn't need 

54
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,100
a bank.  I didn't need a government.  

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,019
I didn't need anybody.  I just needed myself 

56
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,150
and you and our smartphones to do it.  

57
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,319
That's the power of Bitcoin. This is Back

58
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,140
This is Backlight.  Welcome to a world in which we can 

59
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,130
be our own bank. 

60
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,310
We take it for granted that money 

61
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,500
creation is controlled by governments 

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,470
and banks, but there's a community of 

63
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,630
people who don't see this as a given and 

64
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,790
who get quite worked up about it.

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,410
Wall Street is fraud, America is fraud,

66
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,030
the world is fraud, banks are fraud,

67
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,590
central banks are fraud.  We live in an era

68
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,570
of fraud.  It's all based on fraud, and

69
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,800
they've get a percentage of the fraud. 

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,100
That's the business model.  To suggest

71
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,810
that there is any moral or ethical

72
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,310
aspect to anything that's going on now

73
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,920
is to be completely naive about the fact

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,420
that we live in an era dominated by

75
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,610
financial terrorists.  Terrorists,

76
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,580
terrorists, terrorists, jihadists of banking. 

77
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,709
They are here to kill you and themselves. 

78
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,720
They believe in an ideology, not the

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,700
Koran, but Adam Smith that they

80
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,739
completely misread and interpret as

81
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,780
something to justify they're blowing

82
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,420
themselves up.  

83
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,010
[неразборчиво] is a terrorist,

84
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,660
[неразборчиво] is a terrorist, the central bank of Japan is

85
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,280
a terrorist.  These are the real

86
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,910
terrorists.

87
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,690
Funds received. This community is

88
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,340
switching to what they think is a better

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,250
monetary system, a system in which banks

90
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,710
are no longer needed because payment

91
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,750
could be made directly from one person 

92
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,890
to another. The system of debt, one of the

93
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,010
two parties is always the slave. And that

94
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,960
is the architecture of money we live in. 

95
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,030
That is the architecture of money we use

96
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,280
in our civilization, an architecture of

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,080
money where you have no control, an

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,030
architecture of money where every

99
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,430
interaction is mediated by a third party,

100
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,770
a third party that has absolute control

101
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,920
over that money.  Bitcoin is fundamentally

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,200
different because in Bitcoin you don't

103
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,470
owe anyone anything and no one owes you

104
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,570
anything.  It is not a system based on

105
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,149
that.  It is a system based on ownership

106
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,790
and no one can censor it, no one can

107
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,510
seize it,

108
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,300
no one can freeze it.  And what they will

109
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,400
tell you is that they're worried, they're

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,250
very worried.  They're worried that criminals

111
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,460
will use Bitcoin.  But the truth is that

112
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,040
they're far more terrified that all of

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,930
the rest of us will.  Thank you.

114
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,970
Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that was

115
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,100
mostly known as a convenient tool for

116
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,140
criminals, has suddenly become an

117
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,000
important topic at conferences on

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,350
financial innovation all over the world. 

119
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,000
Proponents speak passionately of a

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,220
digital miracle that can save the world

121
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,700
from financial ruin.  The Bitcoin story

122
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,790
starts off like a gospel revelation.  It's

123
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,090
November 2nd, 2008, just six weeks

124
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,040
after the Lehman Brothers collapsed.  And

125
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,350
all over the world there are panicked

126
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,410
debates about how to save the banks.  Then

127
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,630
on a little visited web forum for

128
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,180
cryptographers, a document appears in

129
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,790
which a completely new monetary system

130
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,460
is proposed.  The visionary author calls

131
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,620
himself Satoshi Nakamoto.

132
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,420
First time I heard about it I was at

133
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,420
lunch with a buddy in Texas and he said, 

134
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,170
"Man, there's just crazy new money."  And so,

135
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,790
he talked about it over lunch and then I

136
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,590
went home and I said, "Man, I want to -- I 

137
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,260
want to see if I can buy some."  At first, I

138
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,190
wanted to buy some.

139
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm emailed, a friend of mine.  I think I 

140
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,190
probably saw the white paper, it's a web

141
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,140
form or something.  You know, it just said

142
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,910
this is some electronic currency thing. 

143
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,360
And this was publicly available.  You know,

144
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,040
this was posted, 

145
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,300
what am I thinking, December, 2008, or 

146
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,590
something. And these were the darkest 

147
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,380
days of the financial crisis.  So that to 

148
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,110
me suggests a very clever mind.  That saw 

149
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,000
an opportunity, the perfect opportunity, 

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,030
to introduce a new radical technology 

151
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,530
and a new radical approach to money in 

152
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,600
finance at just the right moment when 

153
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,790
people would be very open to making this 

154
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,760
big shift.  It's required to adopt a new 

155
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,280
currency. I'm pretty sure if 

156
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,200
Satoshi is a human being, although I'd 

157
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,940
really love to go find out with 

158
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,250
some advanced AI.  But 99.99% chance he was 

159
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,860
a human being. What's exciting for me 

160
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,600
is like a global economy.  Right now, we 

161
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,490
say we have a global economy, but I can't 

162
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,990
take a dollar and give it to you in the 

163
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,400
Netherlands and then you know what to do 

164
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,020
with it, right.  You would have to go and 

165
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,780
change it to your native currency.  And 

166
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,250
when you kind of eliminate that step and 

167
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,750
I can just send you one form of payment 

168
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,170
and you can send me a product, in a 

169
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,270
matter of seconds, that starts to change 

170
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,000
things from a global perspective, 

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,179
so.

172
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:06,419
The first wire that I sent was for 

173
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,479
$25,000 and this was in early 2011 and 

174
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,550
Bitcoins were somewhere around $1.  All 

175
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,709
the way along I was buying Bitcoin.  And 

176
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,809
any time I meant to earn some dollars for 

177
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:19,059
my other company, I put it into Bitcoin.  

178
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,099
And at this point, the vast majority of 

179
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,019
my net worth I've been keeping a Bitcoin 

180
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:30,879
for a while now.  I'm glad you didn't get t

181
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,739
he parking payment.  The car is actually like 

182
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:34,179
the perfect color for Bitcoin.  It's like 

183
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:36,249
the Bitcoin Orange, so we wanted to order 

184
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,229
some like Bitcoin Decals and put like 

185
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,269
Bitcoin logos around the car and then 

186
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,099
drive around Tokyo to hope help 

187
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,289
advertise a Bitcoin, but still never got 

188
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:45,879
around to doing that, maybe someday.

189
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,269
Roger Ver is the CEO of MemoryDealers.com, 

190
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,699
selling secondhand computer 

191
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,099
equipment.  But for a couple of years now 

192
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,149
he's been known as the Bitcoin Jesus.  In 

193
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:01,089
2011, he bought $25,000 worth of Bitcoins 

194
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,369
which now have a market value of $6 

195
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:07,300
million. And somebody closed my -- 

196
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,589
I usually leave the trunk or the hood 

197
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:12,789
open a little bit so that I can 

198
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,829
reconnect the battery, but I don't know 

199
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,419
how it got closed between now and the 

200
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,759
last time I was here.  So, we'll have to --

201
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,229
Some people think of Bitcoin as sort of 

202
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,269
an early adopter thing like, "Okay, I'm 


203
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,279
already too late" or "So isn't that a 

204
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,159
problem for Bitcoin? So, thinking that 


205
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,229
that it's too late to get involved in 

206
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,789
Bitcoin is like thinking it's too late 

207
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,380
to get involved with the internet or too 

208
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,849
late to get involved with using a cell 

209
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,099
phone, like, it's not too late to get 

210
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,049
involved with Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is going to 

211
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,490
make your life easier in so many ways 

212
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,160
and the price of Bitcoin, too, it's not 

213
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,540
too late for that either.  Bitcoins like 

214
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,100
$270 a 

215
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,750
Bitcoin right now, if Bitcoin becomes 

216
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,269
really popular all over the world, 

217
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,990
Bitcoins are going to have to be worth 

218
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,790
at least tens of thousands of dollars a 

219
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,439
Bitcoin, if not hundreds of thousands of 

220
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:58,600
dollars per Bitcoin.  So, thinking 

221
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,129
it's too late to get involved with 

222
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:01,750
Bitcoin is like thinking it's too late 

223
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,579
to get involved with using the 

224
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,529
Internet.  Of course, not like it's 

225
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,120
ubiquitous in our lives and Bitcoins 

226
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,529
going to become ubiquitous in our lives 

227
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,860
as well. 

228
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,440
Perfect money should be, have a limited 

229
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,150
supply, that's one of the most important 

230
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,370
things.  It needs have a limited supply, it 

231
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,770
needs to be easily recognizable, it needs 

232
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,570
to be durable, it needs to be 

233
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,910
transportable.  Bitcoin has all those 

234
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,350
things better than any other form of 

235
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,730
money the world has ever seen.  And that's 

236
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,260
why when I noticed Bitcoin for the first 

237
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,630
time, I realized that it's so incredibly 

238
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,070
useful as money that people are going to 

239
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,550
start using it more and more.

240
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,560
Roger lives and works in Tokyo. 

241
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,690
He's outsourcing all the work for his 

242
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,880
own company so he can spend all his time 

243
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,990
promoting Bitcoin. So, it's a pretty 

244
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,820
exciting time for Bitcoin right now with 

245
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,280
all the stuff going on in Greek.  I 

246
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,020
mean, Bitcoins up about $10 since 

247
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,780
yesterday.  Just since all the news on the 

248
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,930
Greek referendum vote and just every day 

249
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,240
Bitcoins so exciting so on.  You can see 

250
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,130
lots of trading and everything 

251
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,270
just in the last 24 hours there.  I paid 

252
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,830
to put up a billboard in the heart of 

253
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,390
Silicon Valley right next to one of the 

254
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,880
busiest expressways that just said we 

255
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,250
accept Bitcoin MemoryDealers.com and 

256
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,780
then listed some of the parts that we 

257
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,370
sell.  Then after that I started paying 

258
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,520
for national radio ads in the United 

259
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,110
States to run more than a hundred radio 

260
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,820
stations across the United States and 

261
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,230
paid for that for a couple of years. OK 

262
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,780
Wave, a popular consumer website in Japan 

263
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,420
will accept Bitcoins from now on at a 

264
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,350
press conference 

265
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,140
Roger Ver helps them spread the word.

266
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,690
But today, one Bitcoin is 35,000 yen. 

267
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,940
If Bitcoin becomes popular worldwide 

268
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,760
then this will definitely be millions, 

269
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,940
or tens of millions.

270
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,500
Roger will now explain things for us. 

271
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,720
Roger, can you tell us 

272
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,310
what's so good about Bitcoin?

273
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,010
Here it says what good money means 

274
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,690
but Nathalie speaks better Japanese than I do.

275
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,760
This is hard to explain. 

276
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,800
Do you want to do it?  

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,660
On the screen you can see  

278
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,760
several functions of Bitcoin.

279
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,220
For instance, Bitcoin has no transaction costs.

280
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,170
It's transparent and very open.  

282
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,200
The most important  

283
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
positive aspects of money

284
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,899
are strengthened even more.

285
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,510
The money we used before Bitcoin  

286
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,880
did have a couple

287
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
of these functions.

288
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,770
But for the first time in history,   

289
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,860
now there is Bitcoin.

290
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,870
It has the best qualities of money, 

291
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,620
and it will become the best currency worldwide.

292
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,100


293
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,680
Who has a Bitcoin wallet?  I'll send you money now.  

294
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,860
— Sent.  It already arrived. Quick, huh?
— Yes, it arrived.

295
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:12,390
— In less than five seconds.
— Yes, quick.

296
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:20,070
If you install the app — did you send it?  
It arrived, right?  

297
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,650
Now this is worth 1000 yen, but if it takes off worldwide, 

298
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,420
it could become a million.

299
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,790
— Roger, are you giving Bitcoins away?

300
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,750

301
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,190
I'm giving every single 

302
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,870
person here 1000 yen worth of Bitcoins

303
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,880
which is like $8 and something cents.

304
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,319
Okay.

305
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,779
I've given away thousands of whole 

306
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,879
Bitcoins to just various people on 

307
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,410
Facebook that would post their Bitcoin 

308
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,389
address and this is back when Bitcoins 

309
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,589
were a couple of dollars each.  So, I'm 

310
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:49,850
sure those people are pretty happy at 

311
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,569
this point. How could this digital coin 

312
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:56,540
invented by this Satoshi Nakamoto become 

313
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,670
hundreds of times more valuable than the 

314
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,579
dollar and why do enthusiasts like Roger 

315
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,319
Ver want the world to switch to 

316
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:06,350
Bitcoins. To understand this, we need to 

317
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,600
look at how new Bitcoins are created. A 

318
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,199
complex process called mining.  

319
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,370
Promotional videos make it look as if 

320
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,810
everyone can just mine Bitcoins. Millions 

321
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,029
of people all over the world earn real 

322
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,850
crypto money daily.  It's quite simple, 

323
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,120
just download the special software, 

324
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,069
connect to the web, and wait for your 

325
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,910
profits to roll in.  For mining, you don't 

326
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,370
need any special knowledge, you can mine 

327
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,060
at home, at work, or to café, anywhere 

328
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,939
there's access to the internet.  And, in fact, 

329
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:43,339
lots of people have already received a 

330
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,829
good income from mining. It's interesting, 

331
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:49,610
but does it get us -- Does it get you out of the bed 

332
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,500
in the morning, no, it doesn't.  I get it. Huh?

333
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,360
It doesn't get you out of the bed in the 

334
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,759
morning. No, it doesn't.  I get it. Marshall 

335
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,290
Long was one of the world's first 

336
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,189
Bitcoin miners.  Now, he's the CEO of Final 

337
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,410
Hash, a company that professionally mines 

338
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,350
Bitcoins. Okay.  Well, that's fine.  We 

339
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,660
can talk about it more in Chicago.  That's 

340
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,339
fine, so.
Thanks.
Back in the early days, you know, 

341
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,980
I get phone calls from my buddies, "Oh, hey 

342
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,870
man.  I lost 10,000 Bitcoins because my 

343
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,480
computer blew up," right.  Back then one 

344
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,089
Bitcoin was less than a penny, right.  So, 

345
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,430
nobody care, they lost $10.  I don't care, 

346
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,860
right.  Now, 10,000 Bitcoins, that's 

347
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,779
$5 million.  That's a big 

348
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,050
deal, right.  So now it's interesting to 

349
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,790
see how the industry has changed.  There 

350
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,800
wasn't YouTube videos and all these nice 

351
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
things to show you how to mine, so it 

352
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,269
took me about three weeks to hook up 

353
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,459
computer up to figure out how to do this 

354
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,079
mining.  And back in the good 

355
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:46,519
days, that you could take a laptop like 

356
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,339
this and 

357
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,889
you could mine maybe 100 or 200 

358
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,370
coins in a day.  When summer time 

359
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,370
in Houston came, my wife was like, "This AC 

360
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,360
has been on for 24 hours.  It's really hot.  

361
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,610
What you're doing up there?"  I said, "Oh, 

362
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,199
you know, I'm just running some computers." 

363
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,370
And she walks up there and you 

364
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,529
see 50 graphics cards all running at the 

365
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,689
same time and it's very hot.  She's like, 

366
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:12,639
"Okay, you got to get out of 

367
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,350
here. You got to figure something else 

368
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,019
out because it is too hot." Hey, what's up Nerd 

369
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,370
Caves & Fans?  Jerry's here AKA 

370
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,350
Barnacules.  I'm here with Marshall Long 

371
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,499
from @FinalHash.  Now we're out here 

372
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,809
and I would say what's going to be the 

373
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,569
largest Bitcoin mine in North America.  

374
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,329
And it's realistically an actual mining 

375
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,589
operation like you can pretty much 

376
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:33,819
attribute everything that's going on 

377
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:35,740
here.
— It's a gold mine.
— So, it's like, a real gold mining 

378
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,939
operation. It's like you have heavy 

379
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:39,220
equipment.  You have cost.  You have fuel cost.

380
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,649
— Yeah.
— And you have recovery.
— Everything.

381
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,360
That you then go and sell and turn into 

382
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,079
real money.
That's right.

383
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,970
Okay.  How many of these machines are in 

384
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,280
here?  You got S4s, S5s every day.  

385
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,810
Actually, this looks like mostly S4 is on.

Unidentified male:    Mostly S4s in here.

386
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,440
This is literally the loudest place ever.  It's 

387
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,339
like being in a wind 


tunnel.  Got air bullet through the top.  Move your head around and these things are all blowing out massive air.  Now, the 

388
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,230
cooling in here is so efficient.  And if 

389
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,000
you put your hand back here behind the 

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,770
units where they're drawing air, it's 

391
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,710
freezing cold.  It is nice ice-cold air 

392
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,690
coming in here.  You put your hand in the 

393
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,840
front down the center, 

394
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:35,240
it is burning, burning hot. 


So, if you're asking yourself, is Bitcoin mining profitable on this scale?  Hell, yes, it is.

395
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,200
A Bitcoin is the reward for solving 

396
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,260
complex mathematical puzzles and Bitcoin 

397
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,600
miners let their computers work day and 

398
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,540
night to complete these tasks.  All the 

399
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,700
Bitcoin users in the world are connected 

400
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,490
and together they constitute a network 

401
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,920
that processes and checks all Bitcoin 

402
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,080
transactions in a public ledger called 

403
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,510
the Blockchain and Satoshi Nakamoto 

404
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,850
designed it in such a way that users can 

405
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,950
create a free and anonymous Bitcoin 

406
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,849
account number, a so-called Wallet.  

407
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,410
Satoshi's invention eliminates the need 

408
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,050
for a central bank because all the users 

409
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,980
together are the bank.  But early Bitcoin 

410
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,859
users had no idea how big Bitcoin and 

411
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,619
the Blockchain would become. I think 

412
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,780
sometime in spring of 2010, I could be 

413
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,900
wrong on the exact dates.  But basically, 

414
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,760
someone put out a request, saying "Hey, I'd 

415
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,770
like to buy something with Bitcoin.  Will 

416
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,440
anyone buy me a pizza?"  And I believe 

417
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,170
someone here in England bought the 

418
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,320
person in Florida a pizza for 10,000 

419
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,210
or something Bitcoins and maybe 

420
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,520
worth a very large sum of money 

421
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,290
today.  And that was the first Bitcoin 

422
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,440
commercial transaction. Garrick Hileman, 

423
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,780
an economist at the London School of 

424
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,150
Economics, was one of the first scholars 

425
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,580
to study Bitcoin and the Blockchain as a 

426
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,200
serious monetary system. As a scholar, I 

427
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,730
think you should have labeled it or was this something 

428
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,320
totally new to you? It looked very 

429
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,850
different to me.  I mean, as soon as I 

430
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,530
heard the word decentralized and the 

431
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,780
fact there was a network powering this 

432
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,880
currency rather than a central issuer, 

433
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,400
that immediately captured my interest as 

434
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,170
something quite different based on what 

435
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,550
little I knew about alternative 

436
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,890
currencies at that time.  What it meant 

437
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,900
for people who are libertarians in 

438
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,420
particular is that the government 

439
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,160
couldn't come in and shutdown a server 

440
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,530
and end Bitcoin, it would have to shut 

441
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,990
down the entire internet or turn off the 

442
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,750
electricity grid to stop Bitcoin.  And 

443
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,210
so that was really attractive to 

444
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,040
people who are worried about these types 

445
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,580
of things. Many of the early Bitcoin 

446
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,950
enthusiasts were libertarians who saw 

447
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,960
Bitcoin 

448
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,730
as the ultimate remedy for state 

449
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,039
intervention.  This was also what 

450
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,770
attracted Roger Ver to Bitcoin.  In his 

451
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,110
early 20s, he was a candidate for the 

452
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,169
Libertarian Party in California.  But 

453
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,330
during his campaign, he was sentenced to 

454
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,890
10 months in prison for trafficking 

455
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,279
illegal fireworks.  According to him, this 

456
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,590
was a political case brought by people 

457
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:14,350
who opposed his ideas. I have a two 

458
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,630
Bitcoin related gears.  I have the Bitcoin.

459
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,080
org, 

460
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,340
and I have the Blockchain.info, 

461
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,200
Bitcoin Blockchain logo.
— Do you think it was a 

462
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,910
political case?
— There's no doubt in my 

463
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,070
mind, whatsoever.  And, in fact, even at one 

464
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,350
of the pre-trial conference things with 

465
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,600
the ATF agents, my attorney and the U.S. 

466
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,550
attorney.  My attorney was saying "Hey, these 

467
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,110
are store-bought firecrackers we sold on 

468
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,940
eBay.  We can pay a fine.  Do some 

469
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,320
community service and you're done with this."  

470
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,090
There's no reason to destroy my life 

471
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,500
over and send me to prison and make me 

472
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,270
a felon.  And the U.S. attorney at that 

473
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,350
point was kind of nodding his head like 

474
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,730
that sounds reasonable.  The ATF agent 

475
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,920
literally pounded his hand on the table 

476
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,570
and shouted, "But you didn't hear the 

477
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,790
things that he said," which I think summed 

478
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,900
up very clearly.  They weren't mad about 

479
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,610
anything that I had done.  They're mad 

480
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,380
about the things that I had said because 

481
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,140
the ideas that I'm trying to spread are 

482
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,170
subversive to the state.  I did 10 months 

483
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,870
in federal prison and I was scared of 

484
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,670
the U.S. government.  The moment I was 

485
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,350
allowed to leave the U.S., I left.  And I 

486
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,870
haven't lived there ever since.  And they 

487
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,340
have what's called the Exit Tax.  So, at the 

488
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,720
time you announced you're a United States 

489
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,060
citizen, they tax you on your entire net 

490
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,800
worth that capital gains tax rates and 

491
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,060
you have to pay them that money 

492
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,430
otherwise they'll probably either send 

493
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,870
you to jail or at the very least not 

494
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,460
ever let you back in the country ever 

495
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,430
again.  If you think about it, it's not all 

496
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,230
that different than slaves from the 

497
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,090
past having to buy their freedom from 

498
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,600
the plantation owner.
— Money creation by 

499
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,760
the state is sort of connected to state 

500
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,100
aggression for you, right?
— In my line of 

501
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,930
thinking as if you or I create 

502
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,640
counterfeit euros or print euros or 

503
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,770
dollars or yen, we would go to jail for 

504
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,510
counterfeiting because it's destructive 

505
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,980
to the economy.  By counterfeiting dollars, 

506
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,870
it's stealing from everybody else in the 

507
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,330
economy that has money.  When governments 

508
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,580
do the exact same thing, it has the exact 

509
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,900
same negative effects.  The only 

510
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,250
difference is they call it fancy names 

511
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,320
like quantitative easing or economic 

512
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,940
stimulus but it's destructive for the 

513
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,840
exact same reasons.  

514
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,730
My hobby growing up and in high school 

515
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,160
and since has been studying economics.  

516
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,660
And the more you study economics, the 

517
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,310
more you realize that all these 

518
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,110
government interventions in the economy 

519
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,150
prevent the world from becoming as 

520
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,680
wealthy and prosperous as it otherwise 

521
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,260
would become.  And suddenly now we have 

522
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,570
this tool that separates money from 

523
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,130
state like everybody today thinks that 

524
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,540
separating church and state.  Yeah, of course, 

525
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,770
they should be separated.  But a couple 

526
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,84
100 years ago, it was heresy: 

527
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,370
just hit that church the state should be 

528
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,930
separated.  And today, it sounds maybe a 

529
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,580
little bit crazy to say that money and 

530
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,410
state should be separated.  But I think in 

531
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,640
another decade or two, people are going 

532
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,810
to think, "Oh, what the heck were we 

533
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,010
thinking letting governments be in 

534
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,840
charge of money that cost so many 

535
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,700
problems in so many misallocations of 

536
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,260
resources around the world?"  Of course, 

537
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,420
Bitcoin is better.
— Okay.  

538
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,600
Thank you.

539
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,400
Why is the governments and banks 

540
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,830
monopoly on money creation seen as 

541
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,220
undesirable?  In his whitepaper, Satoshi 

542
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,590
Nakamoto didn't express his opinion on 

543
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,11
this.  But it does seem that he wanted 

544
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,240
Bitcoins to appreciate rather than 

545
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,110
depreciate unlike money.  He programmed 

546
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,240
Bitcoin in such a way that there's a 

547
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,880
maximum of 21 million Bitcoins to be 

548
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,450
mined.  Bitcoins weren't meant to resemble 

549
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,980
money but gold.  In November 2013, this 

550
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,830
dream became reality when one Bitcoin 

551
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:40,080
was worth an ounce of gold.  The Bitcoin 

552
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,830
code itself has never been hacked.  But in 

553
2014, the customer data of Mt. Gox, an 

554
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,320
online exchange office, was stolen by 

555
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,480
hackers causing the Bitcoin exchange 

556
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,280
rate to plummet.  

557
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,510
At the Financial Times in London, 

558
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,450
journalist Izabella Kaminska has been 

559
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,950
critically following the Bitcoin 

560
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,23
exchange rate and community since the 

561
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,410
very beginning.
— I've always been a geek 

562
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,570
about finance and I've always been a 

563
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,180
geek about how the system works.  So, like 

564
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,100
the really boring nuts and bolts, the 

565
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,100
plumbing of the system.  And I think in 

566
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,530
2008, it was the first time we all really 

567
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,990
fought actually.  Not only is the system 

568
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,970
as it as we know it possibly crumbling, 

569
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,410
there might be opportunities for new 

570
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,820
systems to come up as a result of it.

571
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,120
— Yeah, exactly.
— Why?  Yes, I guess I start writing 

572
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,870
about it again around here, 2012.  And then 

573
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,500
we had the first little rally and then 

574
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,450
this is also clasp.  This is very 

575
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,550
reminiscent to the classic bubble, so.  

576
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,940
So, you see this 

577
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,950
is the famous bubble chart which has 

578
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,560
take off first seller of bear traps as the 

579
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,010
first little micro 

580
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,430
mini dump.  And you go to the new total 

581
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,110
bubble, then it crashes, and it's a bit of 

582
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,570
like a return.  People think maybe it's 

583
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,100
going to come back and then it crashes 

584
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,720
again and then it gets back to a more 

585
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,990
realistic trajectory.  And you'll see that 

586
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,500
that really is very reminiscent to what 

587
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,420
we've seen here.  What everyone is really 

588
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,470
wondering is will we see a consolidation 

589
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,230
of this price or will it recover 

590
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,260
somewhat or will it go completely to 

591
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,530
zero.  And we're really--
— What do you think?

592
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,470
I think what's best for Bitcoin is 

593
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,360
actually if it just stays stable so 

594
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,550
everybody agrees volatility is currently 

595
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,740
the biggest enemy of Bitcoin.
— Satoshi's 

596
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,830
dream, what would that be? The 

597
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,380
paper doesn't really say what his big 

598
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,540
dream was.  He just wanted an efficient 

599
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,050
mechanism that was cheap.  But in terms of 

600
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,120
what I think people have projected his 

601
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,370
vision as being is this world where we 

602
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,430
all are our own 

603
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,230
bank.  We don't have to depend on any 

604
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,150
intermediary.  And banks are gone in the 

605
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,590
current economy because of the way our 

606
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,290
system is structured if I decide to hold 

607
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,470
my dollars, I'm usually holding them in 

608
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,140
an institution that is using them as a 

609
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,260
means of capital raising and they will 

610
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,180
be lending them out.  So, my money even 

611
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,640
though I'm saving, that saving is going 

612
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,950
into an investment somewhere else being 

613
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,350
done by a bank, et cetera.  And it's helping to 

614
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,460
grow the economy.  

615
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,100
So, my saving doesn't disadvantage the 

616
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,780
economy.  But in Bitcoin, there isn't that 

617
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,870
opportunity.  So hoarded Bitcoin is 

618
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,880
a hoarded Bitcoin.  It's totally idle.  

619
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,610
It has no interest, it has no yield; it is 

620
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,800
simply sitting there, doing nothing, and 

621
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,590
yet the person who holds on to it thinks 

622
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,84
they have a right to future income flow 

623
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,450
as if they have been invested.
— When 

624
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,460
the line was flat, people like massively 

625
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,710
bought in or mined Bitcoins.  And they are 

626
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,170
now like multi-millionaire, billionaires.

627
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,070
They're the new 1%.  They're the 1% of the 

628
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,050
Bitcoin economy which again goes against 

629
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,890
the whole democratization side of the 

630
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,020
argument.  Because really, you're not 

631
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,880
democratizing the economy, you're just 

632
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,550
transferring the power from the existing 

633
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,940
elite to a new elite.
The fact that a few 

634
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,610
early Bitcoin miners and investors are 

635
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,820
now multimillionaires is reminiscent of 

636
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,800
the current banking system in which 

637
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,720
bankers are accused of personal 

638
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,050
enrichment.

639
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,290
So I got this degree in international 

640
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,150
development.  And as I was with my dog on 

641
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,940
his Hill and I was like, "Yeah, what could 

642
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,610
I do?  I would go try and work in something like, say, 

643
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,320
East Africa.  I could try to go and explore 

644
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,880
economies there and see what's happening

645
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,65
which I things."  And I was like 

646
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,110
"Why don't I just try and break into the 

647
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,120
financial sector in London?  Thought it would 

648
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,980
actually be really, really fascinating.  

649
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,360
That'd be really amazing."  And then once I 

650
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,370
had that thoughts, I couldn't -- I mean, I 

651
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,750
just became obsessed with this idea.

652
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,910
Brett Scott is the author of the book, 

653
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,220
Hacking the Future of Money, about 

654
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,740
reforming the financial sector to 

655
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,299
immerse himself in the system he 

656
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,610
criticized he worked for two years as a 

657
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,520
broker in the city of London.
— We're now 

658
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,410
in the city.  We just passed the border 

659
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,530
checkin.
— Huh.  Yeah.
— There's check ins marked at the 

660
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,780
boundaries of the City of London.
— It's 

661
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,380
the financial district.

662
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,840
Cut off of my hair, I bought my first 

663
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,080
suit.  Interestingly enough, I had two 

664
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,890
interviews with Lehman Brothers 

665
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,180
literally weeks before they went bust.  

666
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,450
And I remember being up in the, sort of, like the 35th 

667
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,890
floor or something.  And the guy was like 

668
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,150
"I know everything's fine, everything's 

669
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,990
fine.  

670
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,000
Don't believe the stories 

671
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,70
you've seen in the press about us."  And then 

672
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,760
they went under.  "If you created an entire 

673
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,190
society that was reliance on Bitcoin, yeah, 

674
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,270
you'd have massive problems with 

675
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,080
inequality."  But it's very important 

676
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,390
in that it's forms a kind of counter 

677
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,250
power to the existing bank payment 

678
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,060
system.  So, while I can critique Bitcoin 

679
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,280
as much as you want, I'm always 

680
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,110
aware that's the existing 

681
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,600
bank system is highly flawed and I 

682
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,430
lacked the fact that this exists as an 

683
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,320
alternative.  What's happening right now 

684
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,540
in a lot of the banking scene is just move 

685
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,340
towards -- it's called a cashless society.  

686
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,240
But if you think what would that actually 

687
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,520
means, it means every single payment that 

688
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,890
you undertake has to go via a commercial 

689
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,950
bank.  Now, that means every single 

690
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,500
transaction you ever do will be 

691
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,240
monitored and recorded in a database 

692
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,570
somewhere.  It means you'll always be 

693
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,720
giving fees to various credit 

694
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,330
card companies and so on.  So, there's 

695
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,500
potential achievements of 

696
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,520
surveillance.  There's all sorts of 

697
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,450
problems that come with a cashless 

698
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,090
society.  In that world something like 

699
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,500
Bitcoin, which is an electronic version 

700
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,130
of cash or electronic full of, I guess, an 

701
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,540 
electronic equivalent to cash, becomes 

702
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,059
quite important.  

703
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:17,430
So St. Paul's Cathedral across there, 

704
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,350
which is 

705
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,580
where the Occupy movement set up camp 

706
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,800
in London and they were there for a long time.  They 

707
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,080
tried to occupy the London Stock 

708
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,840
Exchange, but weren't able to get in, so they 

709
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,930
show to St. Paul's instead.
— You think of 

710
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,850
Bitcoin and the whole movement being as 

711
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,570
a sort of better form of Occupy?
— It's a 

712
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,700
different form of Occupy.  Maybe it's a 

713
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,370
follow-on from the Occupy 

714
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,160
movement in some ways.
— Bitcoin as a form 

715
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,230
of protest against the current banking 

716
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,690
system is propagated in the Netherlands 

717
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,330
by three Bitcoin enthusiasts who have 

718
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,300
created an app called Bitcasa and who 

719
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,220
are now trying to convince all retailers 

720
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,280
in Arnhem to accept Bitcoins.

van der Meijde: (Speaking Foreign Language) When I talk to people about how Bitcoin works, at first they're surprised. They think it's very special.  But these people also don't have a clue how the current system works.  Because it's pretty hard to believe how it works.

 

Rogier Eijkelhof:       (Speaking Foreign Language) People feel a lot of resistance, or they even deny that there are a few companies that create all the money and that people, companies, and even governments borrow it from these banks.  But these banks literally create it out of thin air, so that's very wrong.

Annet de Boer:          (Speaking Foreign Language) This is the map of Arnhem.  This is the center, and here's the fashion quarter.  You can see that the Bitcoin acceptors are spread out, but mostly in the center there's a huge number of Bitcoin acceptors.

Unidentified male:     (Speaking Foreign Language) You can spend a fun week here without euros?

Annet de Boer:          (Speaking Foreign Language) Yes, you can have a lot of fun.  You can spend the night, there are leisure activities like the wine museum, bowling.

van der Meijde: (Speaking Foreign Language) We've already had several Bitcoin tourists who came to Arnhem because we started something here that allows you to have a great weekend, while only spending Bitcoins.
Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) Not so many payments yet, right?

Unidentified male:     (Speaking Foreign Language) No, not so many.  A couple of people have used Bitcoins, but--

Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) But there could be more.

Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) Definitely.  I prefer Bitcoins to debit card payments, but we'll see.  Everyone's so crazy about debit cards, but everybody has a smartphone.  And banks just take too much money for everything.  So you have to rent or buy a terminal, you have to buy bundles, the deposits, all those things together just cost too much money.

Unidentified male:     (Speaking Foreign Language) As an entrepreneur, you get Bitcoins but through the BitKassa system you get paid in euros?

Unidentified male:     (Speaking Foreign Language) Yeah.

Unidentified male:     (Speaking Foreign Language) And when would you decide to keep the Bitcoins and not change them into euros?

Unidentified male:     (Speaking Foreign Language) If there's really a tipping point.  When you really start noticing a snowball effect, which you see it grow and you think, "This is going to work."  And then we just continue.

van der Meijde: (Speaking Foreign Language) These students will all receive Bitcoins. Tonight, we'll hand them out.  Yes?  I'll send the Bitcoins now.  They should all arrive at the same time.  They're on their way.
Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) Yes, I've got it.  12.79.

van der Meijde: (Speaking Foreign Language) 12.79?
Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) Yes.

Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) 63,000 Bitcoins.

van der Meijde: (Speaking Foreign Language) How is it different from the euro, you think?
Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) It goes up and down much more.

van der Meijde: (Speaking Foreign Language) The exchange rate?
Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) Yes.

Unidentified male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) You don't really know what you have.  For instance, we just got 12.69, but now it's 12.72.


787
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,870
Beside the ease of use, the Arnhem 

788
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,580
students have also noticed a less 

789
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,470
pleasant quality to Bitcoins.  

790
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,470
The fluctuating exchange rate compared 

791
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,540
to other currencies which could make a 

792
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,730
beer a couple of cents cheaper or more 

793
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,910
expensive between ordering and serving.

794
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,520
So Bitcoin in my mind definition is 

795
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,320
not money.  The key to something being 

796
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,590
money in my opinion is that it's a 

797
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,960
widely used unit of account meaning that 

798
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,030
goods and services are priced in it.  So 

799
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,980
when you go to the coffee shop you see 

800
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,960
something priced in Bitcoin.  That's not 

801
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,440
true.  

802
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,630
There are coffee shops where there are 

803
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,610
prices in Bitcoin, but that price is 

804
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,220
changing constantly based on the 

805
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,429
currency it's linked to.  So, the pound, for 

806
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,980
example, here in England lost 20% of its 

807
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,899
value recently.  But the price of coffee 

808
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:14,239
didn't change, it was still 99p.  

809
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,070
That's what it means to be a unit of 

810
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,590
account and Bitcoin is not that.  The 

811
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,480
price adjusts based on its exchange rate 


812
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,149
continuously.
— Do you see Bitcoin as a 

813
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,389
form of money or as a digital gold?
— So I 

814
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:30,168
see gold as money.  And I see Bitcoin as 

815
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,629
having all the same properties of gold 

816
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:35,418
with one property that -- actually couple 

817
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:36,859
properties are even better.  So, gold is 

818
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:39,109
kind of hard to divide.  Bitcoin divides 

819
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:40,639
down to eight decimal points instantly 

820
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,850
super easily.  

821
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,469
Gold is really, really difficult to 

822
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,179
transport.  If I want to transport gold 

823
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,489
from here to Moscow, it'll cost a bunch 

824
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,080
of money to do that and it's dangerous, 

825
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,520
you have to have armed guards, and who 

826
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,310
knows what.  With Bitcoin, I can send Bitcoin 

827
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,530
from here to Moscow or to the Holland 

828
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,470
instantly just like that basically for 

829
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,630
free.  I don't have to pay for a bunch of 

830
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,750
armed guards.  It just happens almost like 

831
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,680
magic.
— If you ever ask somebody why they 

832
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,420
think gold's valuable, can everybody tell 

833
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,070
you, they would just give you like weird stories 

834
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,500
around ads like a precious metal, isn't it?  

835
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,930
It's pretty.  While we think it has 

836
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,640
all its intrinsic value, this intrinsic 

837
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
value of gold has been largely 

838
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,240
constructed in people's heads.  It's often 

839
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,070
by a shield like association with power, 

840
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,290
association with religious figures, and 

841
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,560
Bitcoin has potential for similar 

842
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,510
types of construction.  You could create 

843
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,850
the sense of this almost like a 

844
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,880
commodity like token that has no 

845
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,670
immediate sort of value to it, but can be 

846
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,110
imbued with value.

847
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,140
As more people start to mind, they become 

848
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,900
harder and harder to find.  So it's kind 

849
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,330
of been -- I correlated to like an arms 

850
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,830
race, right.  The guy with the biggest gun 


851
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,700
wins at this point.  So, this is the newest 

852
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,440
place we've started working on here.  

853
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,020
This is a place in the mountains in China.  

854
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,450
It's cool and it doesn't rain 

855
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,240
that much so we can cool it very efficiently.

856
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,400
How much do you pay for that electricity 

857
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,300
on a daily basis?

858
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,550
I'll lend all of my minds together.  

859
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,680
We're probably paying about $100,000, 

860
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,030
maybe a little bit more. 
—A day? 
—Yeah.
—You're 

           paying $100,000 a day? 

861
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,910
I'm sorry.  That's per month, I'm sorry.

862
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,150
Okay. Okay. —But Bitcoin in general, 

863
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,220
all myself and all my colleagues combined, 

864
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,990
it's about a million dollars a day in power.

865
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,540
In power consumption? —Yeah. —And you guys 

866
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,810
generate what worth of coins?

867
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,780
We're generating -- of course, it depends 

868
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,410
on the price, right.  But --

			Uh-huh.  The current market price?

869
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,570
Right.  So, we'll just say for 250.  We'll just put the 

870
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,810
price at $250 for easy numbers.  

871
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,750
You're finding roughly around 25 Bitcoins 

872
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,480
every 10 minutes, so you just take that 

873
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,900
and times it by an hour.  So, you're finding 

874
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,000
around 150 Bitcoins an hour.  Take that 

875
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,060
times 24 and you do that times 250.  

876
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,890
Do some practical.  So, we're making about $900,000 

877
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,650
per day.  So, a lot of 

878
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,220
people ask, "How is that possible?"  

879
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,020
And the reality is a lot of the Chinese guys.  

880
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,580
They are mining at a negative profit.  

881
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,560
One of my friends in Beijing I met him last month.  

882
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,080
I met him up again and I asked him, 

883
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,480
"Last time I checked, man, your power was 

884
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,800
pretty expensive.  Why are you still mining?"  

885
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,410
And his only words were, "I can't stop."  

886
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,020
"So, what do you mean you can't stop, 

887
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,750
you're losing money?"  He's like "Well, I can't.  

888
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,090
I have all these pieces 

889
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,910
of equipment and I just can't stop."

890
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,100
It's gold fever, right? That's right.  

891
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,900
And it's interesting because a lot of 

892
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,880
my colleagues don't see it 

893
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,710
as a business 

894
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,460
subconsciously.  They kind of 

895
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,260
get addicted to it and kind of get crazy 

896
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,859
about it.

(Speaking Foreign Language) This is the first Bitcoin mine in Changcheng.  Three floors, we're on the first.  On this scale and with this equipment we can mine 20 to 25 Bitcoins a day.  There are 3000 computers here. 

Unidentified Male:    (Speaking Foreign Language) Most employees live here while they're working.  Compared to other employees in traditional lines of business, our employees make a lot of money.

Jin Xin:                      (Speaking Foreign Language) This is the room where employees can relax.  They lead a simple, maybe even boring life.  When they're not working, they sleep, read, or play with their mobile phones.

912
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,700
So what was supposed to be a very 

913
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,380
democratic system has ended up 

914
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,560
concentrating it exactly the same way 

915
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,050
that we have seen the bank's concentrate 

916
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,170
their business.  So now you have most of 

917
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,620
the miners are based in China or most of 

918
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,790
the miners are huge server farms that 

919
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,530
the average person can't be 

920
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,050
a miner anymore in Bitcoin.  It's far, 

921
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,810
that the barriers to entry are now really, 

922
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,350
really quite expensive that you have to 

923
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,530
invest in at least 

924
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,030
thousands of dollars of equipment if you

925
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,920
want to be a miner. And a lot of people 

926
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,750
who got into the first year of Bitcoin 

927
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,020
actually had mental breakdowns.  It was so 

928
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,090
beautiful.  It was like you're seeing 

929
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,980
some of the most remarkable art 

930
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,930
ever for the first time. One of the 

931
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,640
qualities that I don't like about the 

932
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,280
community is that it's extremely 

933
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,920
absolutist.  It's very politically led 

934
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,040
and it assumes that it's political ideology 

935
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,530
is the correct one and it kind of 

936
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,990
frosts its political ideology on everybody 

937
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,380
else.  

938
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,320
So, say I don't want political 

939
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,810
ideology when I'm paying for my coffee.  

940
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,120
I just want a payment network that works 

941
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,400
and that allows me to benefit from 

942
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,890
smooth transaction.

943
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,670
Lots of paper money.  

944
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,920
So this is a receipt and this is my 

945
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,710
public address and private key.

946
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,330
You got it covered for us so we cannot film it.

947
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,840
That's right.

948
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:41,769
Over the past two years, new members are 

949
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:43,329
increasingly joining the Bitcoin 

950
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:46,119
community not for ideological reasons 

951
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,839
but for practical ones. --In Kiev, there are 

952
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,029
some protests happening so people start 

953
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:54,160
using social media to share their QR code.  

954
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,959
Within a matter of days, they 

955
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,880
automatically had $15,000 

956
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,910
in their wallets from

957
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,979
sympathizers to the protest that money 

958
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:04,569
was transferred from around the world.  

959
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:07,119
It's an incredibly powerful example because 

960
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,670
today I spent seven years in Nicaragua 

961
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,829
and today I still cannot use PayPal 

962
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:13,809
to transfer money to my friends in 

963
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:17,019
Nicaragua. —Whether or not Bitcoin will be 

964
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,390
worth millions isn't the main question 

965
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,880
for many computer scientists, investors 

966
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,059
and hackers.  To them, Satoshi Nakamoto's 

967
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:26,939
real invention is the Blockchain 

968
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:30,279
technology, a global open ledger which 

969
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,529
can be used to share much more than just 

970
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:33,039
money.

971
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:35,109
You may think that Bitcoin is just 

972
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:36,819
another way to pay for a cup of coffee, 

973
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:39,3
but it's not.  Bitcoin is just the 

974
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:42,069
denomination used to pay the toll to put 

975
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:45,929
stuff on this global ledger.  

976
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:48,729
Now if you think about it, time stamp 

977
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:52,539
recordings of deaths, births, property 

978
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:55,779
transactions, votes, this is the entire 

979
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,380
fabric of our civilization which makes 

980
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,999
the Blockchain one of the most profound 

981
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,369
human innovations of our time because 

982
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:05,829
having a massive global ledger as a 

983
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:08,979
public utility can completely reorganize 

984
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:12,509
the way that we run our societies.

985
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:15,900
Fundamentally, Blockchain is a database 

986
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,369
sort of mechanism and it's a standard, 

987
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,579
it's a protocol.  And one of the problems 

988
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:23,739
we have in an increasingly globalized 

989
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:25,749
system is that everyone is operating 

990
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:26,949
their systems on their own local 

991
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:29,589
standards.  And getting people to do 

992
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,359
everything in a uniform way that 

993
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,089
benefits all of us like 

994
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,319
bringing 

995
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,930
in the metric system.  That is really, 

996
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,269
really hard.  Blockchain offers 

997
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:42,890
an opportunity to start this new exciting 

998
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,219
technological industry from a 

999
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:49,979
standard that is globalized 

1000
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:52,499
and potentially uniform.  So I see the 

1001
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:58,109
potential that way. —The decentralized 

1002
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,509
Blockchain makes it possible to share 

1003
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:03,150
data publicly without a single party 

1004
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,519
controlling the system.  In the Blockchain, 

1005
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,890
all participants in the network are equal.  

1006
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:12,719
Maybe inventor Satoshi Nakamoto saw 

1007
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,420
Bitcoin as just the first experiment 

1008
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,910
with this form of digital democracy.

1009
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,430
I think Blockchain technology is really 

1010
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,079
authentically fascinating.  I think 

1011
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,769
it's anybody who ignores it and in (Inaudible 00:43:28)

1012
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:30,420
is probably making a mistake.  

1013
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,890
I think it's definitely not going to get 

1014
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,180
smaller.

1015
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,849
But to this day, the true identity of the 

1016
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,799
architect behind this revolutionary 

1017
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:45,089
technology remains a mystery. 

1018
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,859
We can't ask Satoshi questions, which is 

1019
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,749
really frustrating, right.  But it's also 

1020
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:50,339
again part of I think the magic of 

1021
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,440
Bitcoin is that we can all kind 

1022
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,039
of imagine this technology for 

1023
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:58,440
as we see it rather than just as 

1024
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,690
Satoshi did.  So it could be used in 

1025
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,459
this way even if Satoshi didn't intended 

1026
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:04,849
to be this widely 

1027
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:07,709
worldwide distributed thing.  I think 

1028
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:10,199
Satoshi probably did, 

1029
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:12,690
but it still could be that.  And we can 

1030
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,999
make it that. —Satoshi around here 

1031
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,140
somewhere in Tokyo?

1032
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,769
Yeah.  I think I see him right there.  

1033
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:20,880
Oh, that's a question I get a lot actually.  

1034
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,989
A lot of people have asked me who 

1035
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:27,719
Satoshi is since I got in so early.  

1036
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:29,459
I think I've got a pretty good idea, but I 

1037
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,019
like to keep that one close to my chest, so.

1038
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:36,089
Why, I mean, tell me? —Because I'm not 100% 

1039
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:37,829
certain.  And the reality is it 

1040
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:39,359
doesn't really matter, right.  It doesn't 

1041
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,329
matter who Satoshi is because now it's 

1042
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:44,729
kind of grown beyond like a pet project, right.

1043
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:47,490
But what I mean, Satoshi 

1044
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,020
owns how much, how many coins? —I think he's 

1045
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,710
got about 500,000 locked up. —With his 

1046
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,560
Blockchain technology, inventor Satoshi 

1047
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,290
Nakamoto has completely relinquished his 

1048
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,590
control of Bitcoin.  But he does own 

1049
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:05,250
120th of all Bitcoins himself.  So if 

1050
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,650
one day, Bitcoin does become widely 

1051
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,070
accepted as a currency he will be one of 

1052
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,030
the richest people on earth. —People might 

1053
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,970
find that scary, a new currency or system 

1054
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,430
based on an inventor who owns already, 

1055
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,140
well, 120th of all the currency invented?

1056
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,560
Yeah. —Isn't that a problem?

1057
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,750
Satoshi invented one of the most 

1058
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,610
important inventions in the entire 

1059
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,380
history of humankind.  That's going 

1060
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,510
to improve the lives of everybody on the 

1061
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,610
planet for the better.  If he had half of 

1062
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,170
all the Bitcoins, he would still deserve it.

1063
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:45,360
Who do you think Satoshi is? —I think 

1064
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
it's probably a band of people who 

1065
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,860
decided that a nom de plume was the best 

1066
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,530
way to go precisely because if it did 

1067
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,140
take off, there would be too many 

1068
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,680
consequences for a individual, one person, 

1069
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,650
or even a group of people.  And from my 

1070
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,510
perspective, you never make a move of 

1071
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,030
this sort without a myth.  You need a sort 

1072
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,950
of foundation myth.  Every good sort of 

1073
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,380
system of power has a foundation myth.  

1074
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,140
And it's always best if the 

1075
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,080
leader is either anonymous or aloof or 

1076
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,750
in some way distant from the public 

1077
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,460
because you have to create a sort of 

1078
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,850
mythology around him.  And because Satoshi 

1079
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,190
nobody knows he is, 

1080
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,829
this -- if we knew who he was it 

1081
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,450
would almost ruin 

1082
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,400
the whole thing for everybody, I think.

1083
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,760
Why did he disappear, you think?

1084
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,099
He undermined the ability of every single 

1085
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,510
government on the entire planet to 

1086
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,460
control the money supply.  And that's how 

1087
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,680
every single government in the world is 

1088
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,030
controlling their citizens and their 

1089
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,390
economies today.  And he just basically 

1090
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,650
knocked their feet right out 

1091
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,730
from under them with the invention of 

1092
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,890
Bitcoin.  And I'm sure that's going to 

1093
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,569
make a lot of people who want to control 

1094
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:54,589
other people by force.  

1095
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:56,690
I'm really, really upset.  So, yeah, I think 

1096
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,339
it's really, really smart for him to have 

1097
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:01,400
disappeared.  And for me, it probably 

1098
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,569
would have been smarter for me to keep 

1099
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,880
quiet, too, but Bitcoins too exciting for me 

1100
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,349
to stay quiet about.  

1101
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,740
I think a lot of people are under 

1102
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,500
estimating the way in which Bitcoin and 

1103
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,900
the Blockchain are going to change 

1104
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,060
the power structures in society in general.  

1105
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,800
I mean, I grew up in the U.S. and 

1106
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,900
I see all these people like, yeah, 

1107
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,730
nuke everybody in the Middle East and kill 

1108
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,350
them all.  And then they have the former 

1109
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,210
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on 

1110
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,460
60 Minutes, one of the most popular news 

1111
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,500
shows in the U.S. and they asked her, 

1112
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,450
they said like, there's reports that more than 

1113
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,640
half a million Iraqi children have died 

1114
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,550
as a direct result of U.S. sanctions.  

1115
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,620
And she looks back at her with a straight 

1116
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,260
face and she goes, "It was a really tough 

1117
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,810
decision, but I think that it was worth 

1118
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:47,260
it."  

1119
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,130
Worth?  Murdering half a million kids 

1120
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,570
because of what the government did?  And I 

1121
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,940
apologized for crying, but it just 

1122
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,850
disgusts me from my core when I see 

1123
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,830
government people murdering people 

1124
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,570
around the world.  It's not just 

1125
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,610
theoretical these were real people with 

1126
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,630
real lives.  

1127
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,200
And it's real people and Bitcoin has the 

1128
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,930
power to undermine everything 

1129
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,520
they're doing to people around the world.  And I'm 

1130
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,950
sorry for shouting, but it just disgusts 

1131
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,440
me what these people in government do.  

1132
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,360
And they do it through central banking and 

1133
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,590
through the control of the money supply 

1134
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,990
and Bitcoin takes that away from them.
