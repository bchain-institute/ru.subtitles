1
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,020
So, we're standing here in my living room

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,269
in Tokyo, Japan.  And I'm going to show 

3
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,759
everybody just how amazing Bitcoin is by

4
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,679
sending a hundred euros worth of Bitcoin

5
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,699
as of today's value through my TV onto

6
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,829
the camera onto the TV in the

7
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:32,329
Netherlands and anybody with their

8
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,280
Bitcoin wallet ready that scans what

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,420
they're going to see on the screen in a

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,280
moment.  We'll be able to claim the 100

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,960
euros worth of Bitcoins and there's

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,579
nothing that anybody can do to stop it

13
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,410
or to freeze your account or block it or

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,719
control it in any way.  So, on the TV here,

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,280
we have a Bitcoin address that I've just

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,859
generated.  And I have my phone here.  I'm

17
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,420
going to scan the QR code for the

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,000
Bitcoin address on the TV.  Now I have it. 

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,010
I'm going to send 100 euros worth of

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,780

Bitcoins to that address.  So, we'll hit send

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,449

and anybody can monitor on Blockchain.info 

22
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,550
the balance of this address.  There

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,829
it is. 100 euros worth of Bitcoins just

24
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,239
arrived at this address.  So, total 

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,120
received 100 euros; final balance, 100

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,520
euros, just like that.  So on this next

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,290
screen you're about to see anybody with

28
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,480
their Bitcoin wallet that scans the

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,310
private key that corresponds with that

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,830
address will be able to claim that

31
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,660
money just by scanning the code that

32
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,710
you're about to see on your television.

33
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,960
So, if you want to take a look, here it 

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,850
comes, 100 euros ready for anyone to 

35
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,100
claim.  All you have to do is scan this

36
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,190
one right here.  And it's 100 euros

37
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,080
worth of Bitcoins as of today.  By the

38
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,760
time you scan it, it might be worth even 

39
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,090
more.

40
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,370
So, there it is for anyone ready to claim

41
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,229
with their Bitcoin wallet.

42
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,990
Okay, Holland, now you've just seen the

43
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,479
power of Bitcoin.  I sent 100 euros

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,189
worth of Bitcoin from here in Tokyo 

45
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,079
directly to you guys through this camera,

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,450
through the network, through the TV right

47
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,640
into your home.  If I had tried to do that â€”

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,289
send you the money with a traditional

49
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,179
bank, it would have taken several days

50
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:58,909
and probably cost 30 euros.  I just did it

51
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,950
right now with Bitcoin instantly,

52
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,590
basically, for free and didn't have to

53
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,509
ask anybody for permission.  I didn't need 

54
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,100
a bank.  I didn't need a government.  

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,019
I didn't need anybody.  I just needed myself 

56
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,150
and you and our smartphones to do it.  

57
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,319
That's the power of Bitcoin. This is Back

58
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,140
light welcome to a world in which we can

59
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,130
be our own bank

60
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,310
we take it for granted that money

61
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,500
creation is controlled by governments

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,470
and banks but there's a community of

63
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,630
people who don't see this as a given and

64
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,790
to get quite worked up about it

65
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,410
Wall Street is fraud America is fried

66
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,030
the world is fraud banks are fraud

67
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,590
central banks are fraud live in an era

68
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,570
of fraud it's all based on fraud and

69
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,800
they get a percentage of the fraud

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,100
that's the business model to suggest

71
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,810
that there is any moral or ethical

72
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,310
aspect to anything that's going on now

73
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,920
is to be completely naive about the fact

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,420
that we live in an era dominated by

75
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,610
financial terrorists terrorists

76
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,580
terrorists she hotties of banking

77
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,709
they're here to kill you and themselves

78
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,720
they believe in an ideology not the

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,700
Koran but Adam Smith that they

80
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,739
completely miss read and interpret as

81
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,780
something to justify their blowing

82
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,420
themselves up Jerry yellows and

83
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,010
terrorists Marriott jaggies and

84
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,660
terrorists the Central Bank of Japan is

85
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,280
a terrorist these are the real

86
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,910
terrorists

87
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,690
those received this community is

88
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,340
switching to what they think is a better

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,250
monetary system a system in which banks

90
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,710
are no longer needed because payment

91
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,750
could be made directly from one person

92
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,890
to another the system of that one of the

93
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,010
two parties is always the slave and that

94
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,960
is the architecture of money we live in

95
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,030
that is the architecture of money we use

96
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,280
a nice civilization an architecture of

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,080
money where you have no control an

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,030
architecture of money where every

99
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,430
interaction is mediated by a third party

100
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,770
a third party that has absolute control

101
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,920
over that money Bitcoin is fundamentally

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,200
different because in Bitcoin you don't

103
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,470
owe anyone anything and no one owes you

104
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,570
anything it is not a system based on

105
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,149
that it is a system based on ownership

106
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,790
and no one can censor it no one can

107
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,510
seize it

108
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,300
no one can freeze it and what they will

109
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,400
tell you is that they're worried they're

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,250
very worried the worried that criminals

111
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,460
will use Bitcoin but the truth is that

112
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,040
they're far more terrified that all of

113
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,930
the rest of us will thank you

114
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,970
Bitcoin the cryptocurrency that was

115
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,100
mostly known as a convenient tool for

116
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,140
criminals has suddenly become an

117
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,000
important topic at conferences on

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,350
financial innovation all over the world

119
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,000
proponents speak passionately of a

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,220
digital miracle that can save the world

121
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,700
from financial ruin the Bitcoin story

122
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,790
starts off like a gospel revelation it's

123
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,090
November the 2nd 2008 just six weeks

124
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,040
after the Lehman Brothers collapse and

125
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,350
all over the world there are panicked

126
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,410
debates about how to save the banks then

127
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,630
on a little visited web forum for

128
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,180
cryptographers a document appears in

129
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,790
which a completely new monetary system

130
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,460
is proposed the visionary author calls

131
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,620
himself Satoshi Nakamoto

132
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,420
first time I heard about it I was at

133
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,420
lunch with a buddy in Texas and he said

134
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,170
man there's just crazy new money and so

135
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,790
he talked about it over lunch and then I

136
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,590
went home and I said man I want to I

137
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,260
want to see if I can buy some at first I

138
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,190
wanted to buy some

139
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm emailed friend of mine I think I I

140
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,190
probably saw the white paper it's a web

141
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,140
form or something you know I just said

142
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,910
this is some electronic currency thing

143
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,360
and this was publicly available you know

144
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,040
this was posted

145
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,300
I think December you know 2008 or

146
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,590
something and these were the darkest

147
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,380
days of the financial crisis so that to

148
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,110
me suggests a very clever mind that saw

149
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,000
an opportunity the perfect opportunity

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,030
to introduce a new radical technology

151
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,530
and new radical approach to money in

152
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,600
finance at just the right moment when

153
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,790
people would be very open to making this

154
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,760
big shift its required to adopt a new

155
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,280
currency I'm pretty pretty sure if

156
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,200
Satoshi is a human being although I'd

157
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,940
really love to go find out they with

158
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,250
some advanced AI but 99.99% chance who

159
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,860
the human being what's exciting for me

160
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,600
is like a global economy right now we

161
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,490
say we have a global economy but I can't

162
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,990
take a dollar and give it to you in the

163
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,400
Netherlands and then you know what to do

164
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,020
with it right you would have to go and

165
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,780
change it to your native currency and

166
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,250
when you kind of eliminate that step and

167
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,750
I can just send you one form of payment

168
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,170
and you can send me a product in a

169
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,270
matter of seconds that starts to change

170
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,000
things from a from a global perspective

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,179
so

172
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:06,419
the first wire that I sent was a for

173
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,479
$25,000 and this was in early 2011 and

174
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,550
bitcoins were somewhere around $1 all

175
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,709
the way along I was buying Bitcoin and

176
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,809
any time I meant turn some dollars for

177
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:19,059
my other company I put it into Bitcoin

178
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,099
and at this point the vast majority of a

179
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,019
my net worth I've been keeping a Bitcoin

180
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:30,879
for a while now I'm glad you didn't get

181
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,739
the parking pay the car is actually like

182
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:34,179
the perfect color for Bitcoin it's like

183
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:36,249
the Bitcoin Orange so we wanted to order

184

185
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,269
Bitcoin logos around the car and then

186
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,099
drive around Tokyo to hope help

187
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:44,289
advertise a Bitcoin but still never got

188
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:45,879
around to doing that maybe someday

189
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,269
Roger fear is the CEO of memory dealers

190
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,699
com selling secondhand computer

191
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,099
equipment but for a couple of years now

192
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,149
he's been known as the Bitcoin Jesus in

193
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:01,089
2011 he bought $25,000 worth of bitcoins

194
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,369
which now have a market value of 6

195
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:07,300
million dollars and somebody closed my

196
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,589
uh I usually leave the trunk or the hood

197
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:12,789
open a little bit so that I can

198
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,829
reconnect the battery but I don't know

199
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,419
how it got closed between now and the

200
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,759
last time I was here so we'll have to uh

201
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,229
some people think of Bitcoin as sort of

202
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,269
an early adopter thing like okay I'm

203
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,279
already too late or so isn't that a

204
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,159
problem for Bitcoin so thinking that

205
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,229
that it's too late to get involved in

206
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:33,789
Bitcoin is like thinking it's too late

207
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,380
to get involved with the internet or too

208
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,849
late to get involved with using a cell

209
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,099
phone like it's not too late to get

210
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,049
involved in Bitcoin Bitcoin is going to

211
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,490
make your life easier in so many ways

212
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,160
and and the price of Bitcoin - it's not

213
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,540
too late for that either bitcoins like

214
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,100
two hundred and seventy dollars a

215
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,750
Bitcoin right now if Bitcoin becomes

216
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,269
really popular all over the world

217
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,990
bitcoins are going to have to be worth

218
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,790
at least tens of thousands of dollars a

219
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,439
Bitcoin if not hundreds of thousands of

220
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:58,600
dollars per Pig per Bitcoin so thinking

221
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,129
it's too late to get involved with with

222
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:01,750
Bitcoin is like thinking it's too late

223
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,579
to get involved with with using the

224
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,529
Internet of course not like it's

225
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,120
ubiquitous in our lives and bitcoins

226
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,529
going to become ubiquitous in our lives

227
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,860
as well

228
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,440
perfect money should be have a limited

229
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,150
supply that's one of the most important

230
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,370
things needs have a limited supply it

231
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,770
needs to be easily recognizable it needs

232
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,570
to be durable it needs to be

233
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,910
transportable Bitcoin has all those

234
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,350
things better than any other form of

235
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,730
money the world has ever seen and that's

236
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,260
why when I noticed Bitcoin for the first

237
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,630
time I realized that it's so incredibly

238
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,070
useful as money that people are going to

239
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,550
start using it more and more

240
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,560
Roger lives and works in Tokyo

241
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,690
he's outsourcing all the work for his

242
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,880
own company so he can spend all his time

243
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,990
promoting Bitcoin so it's a pretty

244
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,820
exciting time for Bitcoin right now with

245
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,280
all the stuff going on in in Greek I

246
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,020

00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,830
to put up a billboard in the heart of

253
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,390

Facebook that would post their Bitcoin

308
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,389
address and this is back when bitcoins

309
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,589
were a couple of dollars each so I'm

310
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:49,850
sure those people are pretty happy at

311
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,569
this point how could this digital coin

312
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:56,540
invented by this Satoshi Nakamoto become

313
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,670
hundreds of times more valuable than the

314
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,579
dollar and why do enthusiasts like Roger

315
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,319
fear want the world to switch to

316
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:06,350
bitcoins to understand this we need to

317
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,600
look at how new bitcoins are created a

318
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,199
complex process called mining

319
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:13,370
promotional videos make it look as if

320
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,810
everyone can just mine bitcoins millions

321
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,029
of people all over the world earn real

322
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,850
crypto money daily it's quite simple

323
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,120
just download the special software

324
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,069
connect to the web and wait for your

325
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,910
profits to roll in for mining you don't

326
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,370
need any special knowledge you can mine

327
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,060
at home at work or to cafe anywhere

328
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,939
there's access to the Internet in fact

329
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:43,339
lots of people have already received a

330
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,829
good income from mining it's interesting

331
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:49,610
just to get us to get you out of the bed

332
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,500
in the morning no it doesn't I get it

333
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,360
it doesn't get you out of the bed in the

334
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,759
morning no it doesn't I get it marshal

335
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,290
Leung was one of the world's first

336
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,189
Bitcoin miners now he's the CEO of final

337
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:03,410
hash a company that professionally mines

338
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,350
bitcoins okay well that's fine we can we

339
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,660
can talk about it more in Chicago that's

340
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,339
fine so back in the early days you know

341
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,980
I get phone calls from my buddies oh hey

342
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,870
man I lost 10,000 bitcoins because my

343
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,480
computer blew up right back then one

344
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,089
Bitcoin was less than a penny right so

345
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,430
nobody cared they lost $10 I don't care

346
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,860
right now 10,000 bitcoins that's you

347
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,779
know five million dollars that's a big

348
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,050
deal right so now it's interesting to

349
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,790
see how the industry has changed there

350
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,800
wasn't YouTube videos and all these nice

351
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
things to show you how to mine so it

352
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,269
took me about three weeks to hook up

353
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,459
computer up to figure out how to do this

354
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,079
mining and you know back in the good

355
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:46,519
days that you could take a laptop like

356
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,339
this and

357
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:50,889
you could mine maybe a hundred or two

358
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:54,370
hundred coins in a day when summer time

359
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,370
in Houston came my wife was like this AC

360
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,360

361
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,610
what were you doing up there I said oh

362
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,199
you know I'm just running some computers

363
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,370
and she walks up there and you know you

364
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,529
see 50 graphics cards all running at the

365
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,689
same time and it's very hot she's like

366
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:12,639
okay you got a you got to get out of

367
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,350
here you got to figure something else

368
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,019
out cuz it is too hot hey what's up nerd

369
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,370
you have some fans cheering here aka

370
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,350
barnacle YZ I'm here with Marshall long

371
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,499
from hath final hash now we're out here

372
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,809
and I would say what's going to be the

373
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:28,569
largest Bitcoin mine in North America

374
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,329
and it's realistically an actual mining

375
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,589
operation like you can pretty much

376
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:33,819
attribute everything that's going on

377
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:35,740
here to like a real gold mining

378
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,939
operation it's like you have heavy

379
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:39,220
equipment you have cost you fuel cost

380
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,649
yeah and you have recovery everything

381
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,360
that you then go and sell and turn into

382
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,079
real money that's right

383
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,970
okay how many of these machines are in

384
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,280
here you got a scores s5 everyday

385
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,810
actually this is mostly a scores

386
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,440
literally the loudest place ever it's

387
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,339
like he in a wing

388
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,230
cooling in here is so efficient and if

389
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,000
you put your hand back here behind the

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,770
units where they're drawing here it's

391
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,710
freezing cold it is nice ice cold air

392
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,690
coming in here you put your hand in the

393
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,840
front down the center

394
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:35,240
is burning burning hi profitable

395
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,200
a Bitcoin as the reward for solving

396
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,260
complex mathematical puzzles and Bitcoin

397
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,600
miners let their computers work day and

398
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,540
night to complete these tasks all the

399
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,700
Bitcoin users in the world are connected

400
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,490
and together they constitute a network

401
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,920
that processes and checks all Bitcoin

402
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,080
transactions in a public ledger called

403
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,510
the blockchain and Satoshi Nakamoto

404
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,850
designed it in such a way that users can

405
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,950
create a free and anonymous Bitcoin

406
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,849
account number a so called wallet

407
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,410
satoshis invention eliminates the need

408
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,050
for a central bank because all the users

409
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,980
together are the bank but early Bitcoin

410
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,859
users had no idea how big Bitcoin and

411
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,619
the blockchain would become I think

412
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,780
sometime in spring of 2010 I could be

413
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,900
wrong on the exact dates but basically

414
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,760
someone put out a request saying hey I'd

415
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,770
like to buy something with Bitcoin will

416
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,440
anyone buy me a pizza and I believe

417
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,170
someone here in England bought the the

418
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,320
person in Florida a pizza for ten

419
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,210
thousand or something bitcoins and maybe

420
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,520
worth you know a very large sum of money

421
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,290
today and and that was the first Bitcoin

422
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,440
commercial transaction garrick Heilmann

423
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,780
an economist at the London School of

424
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,150
Economics was one of the first scholars

425
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,580
to study Bitcoin and the blockchain as a

426
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,200
serious monetary system as a scholar at

427
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,730
you should label it was something

428
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,320
totally new to you it looked very

429
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,850
different to me I mean as soon as I

430
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,530
heard the word decentralized and the

431
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,780
fact there was a network powering this

432
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,880
currency rather than a central issuer

433
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,400
that immediately captured my interest is

434
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,170
something quite different based on what

435
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,550
little I knew about alternative

436
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,890
currencies at that time what it meant

437
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,900
for people who are libertarians in

438
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,420
particular is that the government

439
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,160
couldn't come in and shut down a server

440
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,530
and in Bitcoin it would have to shut

441
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,990
down the entire internet or turn off the

442
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,750
electricity grid - to stop Bitcoin and

443
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,210
so that was really attractive - to

444
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,040
people who are worried about these types

445
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,580
of things many of the early Bitcoin

446
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,950
enthusiasts were libertarians who saw

447
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,960
Bitcoin

448
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,730
as the ultimate remedy for state

449
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,039
intervention this was also what

450
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,770
attracted Roger Vere to Bitcoin in his

451
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,110
early 20s he was a candidate for the

452
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,169
Libertarian Party in California but

453
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,330
during his campaign he was sentenced to

454
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,890
ten months in prison for trafficking

455
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,279
illegal fireworks according to him this

456
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,590
was a political case brought by people

457
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:14,350
who opposed his ideas I have a two

458
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,630
Bitcoin related Gea's I have the Bitcoin

459
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,080
org

460
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,340
and I have the blockchain that info

461
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,200
Bitcoin blockchain logo anything was a

462
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,910
political case there's no doubt in my

463
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,070
mind whatsoever and in fact even at one

464
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,350
of the pre-trial conference things with

465
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,600
the ATF agents my attorney in the US

466
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,550
attorney might renew saying hey these

467
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,110
are store-bought firecrackers we sold on

468
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,940
eBay we can pay a fine and do some

469
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,320
community service and you down with this

470
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,090
there's no reason to destroy my life

471
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,500
over it and send me to prison to make me

472
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,270
a felon and the US Attorney at that

473
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,350
point was kind of nodding his head like

474
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,730
that sounds reasonable the ATF agent

475
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,920
literally pounded his hand on the table

476
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,570
and shed it but you didn't hear the

477
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,790
things that he said which I think summed

478
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,900
up very clearly they weren't mad about

479
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,610
anything that I had done they're not

480
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,380
about the things that I had said because

481
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,140
the ideas that I'm trying to spread are

482
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,170
subversive to the state I did ten months

483
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,870
in federal prison and I was scared of

484
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,670
the US government the moment I was

485
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,350
allowed to leave the u.s. I left and I

486
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,870
haven't lived there ever since and they

487
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,340
have what's called an exit act so at the

488
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,720
time you announced your United States

489
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,060
citizen they tax you on your entire net

490
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,800
worth that capital gains tax rates and

491
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,060
you have to pay them that money

492
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,430
otherwise they'll probably either send

493
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,870
you to jail or at the very least not

494
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,460
ever let you back in the country ever

495
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,430
again if you think about it it's not all

496
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,230
that different than you slaves from the

497
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,090
past having to buy their freedom from

498
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,600
the plantation owners money creation by

499
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,760
the state is sort of connected to state

500
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,100
aggression for you right in my line of

501
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,930
thinking is if you are I create

502
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,640
counterfeit euros or print euros or

503
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,770
dollars or yen we would go to jail for

504
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,510
counterfeiting because it's destructive

505
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,980
to the economy by counterfeiting dollars

506
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,870
it's stealing everybody else in the

507
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,330
economy that has money when governments

508
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,580
do the exact same thing it has the exact

509
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,900
same negative effects the only

510
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,250
difference is they call it fancy names

511
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,320
like quantitative easing or economic

512
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,940
stimulus but it is destructive for the

513
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,840
exact same reasons

514
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,730
my hobby growing up and in high school

515
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,160
and since has been studying economics

516
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,660
and the more you study economics the

517
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,310
more you realize that all these

518
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,110
government interventions in the economy

519
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,150
prevent the world from becoming as

520
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,680
wealthy and prosperous as it otherwise

521
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,260
would become and suddenly now we have

522
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,570
this tool that separates money from

523
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,130
state like everybody today thinks that

524
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,540
separating church and state of course

525
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,770
they should be separated but a couple

526
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,840
hundred years ago it was you know heresy

527
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,370
just hit that church the state should be

528
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,930
separated and today it sounds maybe a

529
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,580
little bit crazy to say that money and

530
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,410
state should be separate but I think in

531
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,640
another decade or two people are going

532
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,810
to think Oh what the heck were we

533
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,010
thinking letting governments be in

534
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,840
charge of money that cost so many

535
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,700
problems in so many misallocation of

536
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,260
resources around the world of course

537
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,420
bitcoin is is better okay

538
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,600
these feathers pick

539
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,400
why is the government's and banks

540
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,830
monopoly on money creation seen as

541
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,220
undesirable in his white paper Satoshi

542
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,590
Nakamoto didn't express his opinion on

543
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,110
this but it does seem that he wanted

544
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,240
bitcoins to appreciate rather than

545
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,110
depreciate unlike money he programmed

546
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,240
Bitcoin in such a way that there's a

547
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,880
maximum of 21 million bitcoins to be

548
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,450
mined bitcoins weren't meant to resemble

549
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,980
money but gold in November 2013 this

550
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,830
dream became reality when one bitcoin

551
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:40,080
was worth an ounce of gold the Bitcoin

552
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,830
code itself has never been hacked but in

553
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,710
2014 the customer data of Mount GOx an

554
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,320
online exchange office was stolen by

555
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,480
hackers causing the Bitcoin exchange

556
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,280
rate to plummet

557
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,510
at the Financial Times in London

558
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,450
journalist Isabella Kaminski has been

559
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,950
critically following the Bitcoin

560
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,230
exchange rate and community since the

561
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,410
very beginning I've always been a geek

562
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,570
about finance and I've always been a

563
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,180
geek about how the system works so like

564
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,100
the really boring nuts and bolts the

565
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,100
plumbing of the system and I think in

566
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,530
2008 it was the first time we all really

567
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,990
fought actually not only is the system

568
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,970
as it as we know it possibly crumbling

569
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,410
there might be opportunities for new

570
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,820
systems to come up as a result of it

571
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,120
exactly why I guess I start writing

572
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,870
about it again around here 2012 and then

573
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,500
we had the first little rally and then

574
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,450
this is also clasp this is very

575
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,550
reminiscent to the classic bubble I know

576
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,940
each other so you see this is the this

577
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,950
is the famous bubble chart which has

578
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,560
take off first Elif bear traps as the

579
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,010
first little micro you know

580
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,430
mini dump and you go to the new total

581
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,110
bubble then it crashes and is a bit of

582
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,570
like a return people think maybe it's

583
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,100
going to come back and then it crashes

584
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,720
again and then it it gets back to a more

585
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,990
realistic trajectory and you'll see that

586
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,500
that really is very reminiscent to what

587
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,420
we've seen here what everyone is really

588
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,470
wondering is will we see a consolidation

589
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,230
of this price or will it recover

590
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,260
somewhat or will it go completely to

591
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,530
zero and we're really what do you think

592
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,470
I think what's best for Bitcoin is

593
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,360
actually if it just stays stable so

594
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,550
everybody agrees volatility is currently

595
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,740
the the biggest enemy of Bitcoin so

596
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,830
she's dreamed what would that be the

597
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,380
paper doesn't really say what his big

598
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,540
dream was he just wanted an efficient

599
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,050
mechanism that was cheap but in terms of

600
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,120
what I think people have projected his

601
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,370
vision as being is this world where we

602
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,430
are we are are all our own

603
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,230
Banke we don't have to depend on any

604
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,150
intermediary and thanks are gone in the

605
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,590
current economy because of the way our

606
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,290
system is structured if I decide to hold

607
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,470
my dollars I'm usually holding them in

608
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,140
an institution that is using them as a

609
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,260
means of capital raising and they will

610
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,180
be lending them out so my money even

611
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,640
though I'm saving that saving is going

612
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,950
into an investment somewhere else being

613
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,350
done by a bank etc and it's helping to

614
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,460
grow the economy

615
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,100
so my saving doesn't disadvantage the

616
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,780
economy but in Bitcoin there isn't that

617
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,870
that opportunity so hoard of Bitcoin as

618
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,880
a hoarded it Bitcoin it's totally idle

619
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,610
it has no interest it has no yield it is

620
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,800
simply sitting there doing nothing and

621
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,590
yet the person who holds on to it thinks

622
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,840
they have a right to future income flow

623
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,450
as if they have been invested in when

624
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,460
the line was flat people like massively

625
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,710
boring or mined bitcoins and they are

626
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,170
now like multi-millionaire billionaires

627
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,070
they're the new 1% they're the 1% of the

628
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,050
Bitcoin economy which again goes against

629
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,890
the whole democratization side of the

630
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,020
argument because really you're not

631
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,880
democratizing the economy you're just

632
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,550
transferring the power from the existing

633
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,940
elite to a new elite the fact that a few

634
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,610
early Bitcoin miners and investors are

635
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,820
now multimillionaires is reminiscent of

636
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,800
the current banking system in which

637
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,720
bankers are accused of personal

638
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,050
enrichment

639
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,290
so I got this degree in international

640
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,150
development and as I was with my dog on

641
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,940
his Hill and I was like yeah what could

642
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,610
I do go try and work and so me I say

643
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,320
East Africa I could go and explore

644
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,880
economies there and see what's happening

645
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,650
like at rallies things and I was like

646
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,110
why don't I just try and break into the

647
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,120
financial sector in London that would

648
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,980
actually be really really fascinating

649
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,360
that'd be really amazing and then once I

650
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,370
had that thought I couldn't I mean I

651
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,750
just became obsessed with this idea

652
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,910
bread scott is the author of the book

653
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,220
hacking the future of money about

654
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,740
reforming the financial sector to

655
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,299
immerse himself in the system he

656
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,610
criticized he worked for two years as a

657
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,520
broker in the city of London we're now

658
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,410
in the city we just passed the border

659
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,530
tracking huh his dragons mark the

660
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,780
boundaries of the City of London it's

661
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,380
the financial district

662
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,840
cut off of my hair I bought my first

663
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,080
suit interestingly enough I had two

664
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,890
interviews with Lehman Brothers

665
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,180
literally weeks before they went bust

666
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,450
and I remember being up and the 35th

667
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,890
floor or something and the guy was like

668
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,150
I know everything's fine everything's

669
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,990
fine here

670
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,000
yeah don't believe the stories heshes

671
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,700
you've seen the press about us and then

672
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,760
they went and if you created an entire

673
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,190
society it was reliant in Bitcoin yeah

674
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,270
you'd have massive problems with

675
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,080
inequality but it's it's very important

676
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,390
in that if it's forms a kind of counter

677
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,250
power to the existing bank payment

678
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,060
system so while I can critique Bitcoin

679
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,280
as much as you want you know I'm always

680
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,110
aware that's you know the glistening

681
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,600
Bank system is highly flawed and I

682
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,430
lacked the fact that this exists as an

683
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,320
alternative what's happening right now

684
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,540
and a lot of the banking scene is moved

685
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,340
towards it's called a cashless society

686
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,240
but if you think what that actually

687
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,520
means it means every single payment that

688
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,890
you undertake has to go via a commercial

689
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,950
bank now that means every single

690
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,500
transaction you you ever do will be

691
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,240
monitored and recorded in a database

692
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,570
somewhere it means you'll always be

693
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,720
giving fees to various you know credit

694
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,330
card companies and so on so there's

695
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,500
there's potential achievements of

696
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,520
surveillance there's all sorts of

697
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,450
problems that come with a cashless

698
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,090
society in that world something like

699
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,500
Bitcoin which is an electronic version

700
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,130
of cash or electronic full of I guess an

701
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,540
electronic equivalent to cash becomes

702
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,059
quite important

703
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:17,430
so st. Paul's Cathedral

704
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,350
which is a

705
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,580
we're the Occupy movement set up camp

706
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,800
London without their for long term they

707
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,080
tried to occupy the London Stock

708
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,840
Exchange but weren't able to get in the

709
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,930
show st. Paul's instead you think of

710
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,850
Bitcoin and the whole movement being as

711
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,570
a sort of better form of Occupy it's a

712
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,700
different full of occupy you know it's a

713
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,370
maybe it's a follow-on from the Occupy

714
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,160
movement in some ways Bitcoin as a form

715
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,230
of protest against the current banking

716
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,690
system is propagated in the Netherlands

717
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,330
by three Bitcoin enthusiasts who have

718
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,300
created an app called bit Casa and who

719
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,220
are now trying to convince all retailers

720
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,280
in arnhem to accept bitcoins a zucchini

721
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,770
mensis break over bitcoin magnatag's

724

sound of alternate for night only

788
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,580
students have also noticed a less

789
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,470
pleasant quality to bitcoins

790
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,470
the fluctuating exchange rate compared

791
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,540
to other currencies which could make a

792
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,730
beer a couple of cents cheaper or more

793
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,910
expensive between ordering and serving

794
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,520
so Bitcoin in my mind effing ition is

795
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,320
not money the key to something being

796
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,590
money in my opinion is that it's a

797
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,960
widely used unit of account meaning that

798
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,030
goods and services are priced in it so

799
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,980
when you go to the coffee shop you see

800
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,960
something priced in Bitcoin that's not

801
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,440
true

802
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,630
there are coffee shops where there are

803
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,610
prices in Bitcoin but that price is

804
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,220
changing constantly based on the

805
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,429
currency it's linked to so the pound for

806
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:09,980
example here in England lost 20% of its

807
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,899
value recently but the price of coffee

808
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:14,239
didn't change it was still 99 p

809
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,070
that's what it means to be a unit of

810
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,590
account and bitcoin is not that the

811
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,480
price adjusts based on its exchange rate

812
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,149
continuously do you see the Bitcoin as a

813
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,389
form of money or as a digital gold so I

814
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:30,168
see gold as money and I see Bitcoin as

815
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,629
having all the same properties of gold

816
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:35,418
with one property that actually couple

817
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:36,859
properties are even better so gold is

818
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:39,109
kind of hard to divide Bitcoin divides

819
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:40,639
down to eight decimal points instantly

820
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,850
super easily

821
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,469
Gold is really really difficult to

822
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,179
transport if I want to transport gold

823
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,489
from here to Moscow it'll cost a bunch

824
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,080
of money to do that and it's dangerous

825
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,520
you have to have armed guards and who

826
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,310
knows what with Bitcoin I can simba coin

827
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,530
from here to Moscow or to the Holland

828
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,470
instantly just like that basically for

829
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,630
free I don't have to pay for a bunch of

830
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,750
armed guards it just happens almost like

831
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,680
magic if you ever ask somebody why they

832
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,420
think Gold's valuable I can already tell

833
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,070
you though it feels like weird stories

834
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,500
around ads like a precious metal isn't

835
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,930
it it it's pretty while we think it has

836
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,640
all its intrinsic value this intrinsic

837
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
value of gold has been largely

838
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,240
constructed in people's here it's often

839
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,070
by a shield like association with power

840
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,290
association with religious figures and

841
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,560
Bitcoin and has potential for similar

842
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,510
types of construction you could create

843
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,850
this the sense of this almost like a

844
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,880
commodity like token that has no

845
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,670
immediate sort of value to it but can be

846
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,110
imbued with value

847
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,140
as more people start to mind they become

848
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,900
harder and harder to find so it's kind

849
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,330
of been at I correlated to like an arms

850
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,830
race right the guy with the biggest gun

851
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,700
wins at this point so this is the newest

852
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,440
place we've started working on here this

853
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,020
is a place in the mountains in China

854
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,450
it's cool and it doesn't rain that much

855
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,240
so we can cool it very efficiently how

856
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,400
much do you pay for that electricity on

857
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,300
a daily basis

858
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,550
um I'll lend all of my minds together

859
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,680
we're probably paying about $100,000

860
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,030
maybe a little bit more a day yeah I'm

861
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,910
paying 100,000 is per month I'm sorry

862
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,150
okay but Bitcoin in general all myself

863
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,220
and all my colleagues combined it's

864
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,990
about a million dollars a day in power

865
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,540
in power consumption and you guys

866
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,810
generate what worth of coins we're

867
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,780
generating of course it depends on the

868
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,410
price right but price right so we'll

869
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,570
just say for 250 now we'll just put the

870
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,810
price at $250 for easy numbers you're

871
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,750
finding roughly around 25 bitcoins every

872
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,480
10 minutes so you just take that and

873
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,900
times it by an hour so you're finding

874
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,000
around 150 bitcoins an hour take that

875
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,060
times 24 and you do that times 250 do

876
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,890
some packet of so we're making about 900

877
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,650
thousand dollars per day so a lot of

878
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,220
people ask how is that possible and that

879
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,020
the reality is a lot of the Chinese guys

880
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,580
they are mining at a negative profit one

881
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,560
of my friends in Beijing I met him last

882
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,080
month I met him up again and I asked him

883
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,480
last time I checked man your power was

884
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,800
pretty expensive why are you still

885
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,410
mining and his only words were I can't

886
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,020
stop so what do you mean you can't stop

887
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,750
you're losing money it's like well I

888
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,090
can't I have all these you know pieces

889
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,910
of equipment and I just can't stop it's

890
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,100
gold fever right that's right and it's

891
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,900
interesting because a lot of the a lot

892
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,880
of my colleagues don't see it as a

893
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,710
business

894
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,460
subconsciously right

895
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,260
get addicted to it and kind of get crazy

896
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,859
about it

897
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,180

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,700
so what was supposed to be a very

913
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,380
democratic system has ended up

914
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,560
concentrating it exactly the same way

915
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,050
that we have seen the bank's concentrate

916
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,170
their business so now you have most of

917
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,620
the miners are based in China or most of

918
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,790
the miners are huge server farms that

919
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,530
you know the average person can't be a

920
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,050
miner anymore in Bitcoin it's far the

921
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,810
the the barriers to entry are now really

922
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,350
really quite expensive that you have to

923
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,530
invest in at least you know you

924
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,030
thousands of dollars of equipment if you

925
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,920
want to be a miner and a lot of people

926
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,750
who got into the first year Bitcoin

927
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,020
actually had mental breakdowns it was so

928
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,090
beautiful it was like you're seeing you

929
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,980
know some of the most remarkable art

930
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,930
ever for the first time one of the

931
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,640
qualities that I don't like about the

932
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,280
community is that it's extremely

933
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,920
absolutist it's very politically led and

934
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,040
it assumes that it's political ideology

935
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,530
is the correct one and it kind of

936
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,990
Frost's its pursue ideology on everybody

937
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,380
else

938
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,320
so say you know I don't want political

939
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,810
ideology when I'm paying for my coffee I

940
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,120
just want a payment network that works

941
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,400
and that allows me to benefit from

942
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,890
smooth transaction

943
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,670
lots of paper money

944
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,920
so this is a receipt and this is my

945
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,710
public address and private key you got

946
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,330
it covered for us so we cannot film it

947
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,840
that's right

948
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:41,769
over the past two years new members are

949
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:43,329
increasingly joining the Bitcoin

950
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:46,119
community not for ideological reasons

951
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:49,839
but for practical ones in Kiev there are

952
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,029
some protests happening so people start

953
00:40:52,029 --> 00:40:54,160
using social media to share their QR

954
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,959
code within a matter of days they

955
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,880
automatically had fifteen thousand

956
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,910
dollars in their wallets from

957
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,979
sympathizers to the protest that money

958
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:04,569
was transferred from around the world

959
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:07,119
say incredibly powerful example because

960
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,670
today I spent seven years in Nicaragua

961
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,829
and today I still cannot use PayPal to

962
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:13,809
transfer money to my friends in

963
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:17,019
Nicaragua whether or not Bitcoin will be

964
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,390
worth millions isn't the main question

965
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,880
for many computer scientists investors

966
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,059
and hackers to them Satoshi nakamoto's

967
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:26,939
real invention is the blockchain

968
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:30,279
technology a global open ledger which

969
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,529
can be used to share much more than just

970
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:33,039
money

971
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:35,109
you may think that bitcoin is just

972
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:36,819
another way to pay for a cup of coffee

973
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:39,369
but it's not Bitcoin is just the

974
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:42,069
denomination used to pay the toll to put

975
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:45,929
stuff on this school baletta

976
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:48,729
now if you think about it time stamp

977
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:52,539
recordings of deaths births property

978
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:55,779
transactions votes this is the entire

979
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,380
fabric of our civilization which makes

980
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,999
the blockchain one of the most profound

981
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:03,369
human innovations of our time because

982
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:05,829
having a massive global ledger as a

983
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:08,979
public utility can completely reorganize

984
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:12,509
the way that we run our societies

985
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:15,900
fundamentally blockchain is a database

986
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,369
sort of mechanism and it's a standard

987
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,579
it's a protocol and one of the problems

988
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:23,739
we have in an increasingly globalized

989
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:25,749
system is that everyone is operating

990
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:26,949
their systems on their own local

991
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:29,589
standards and getting people to do

992
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,359
everything in a uniform way that

993
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,089
benefits all of us like you know

994
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,319
bringing

995
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,930
in the metric system that is really

996
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,269
really hard blockchain offers an

997
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:42,890
opportunity to start this new exciting

998
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,219
technological you know industry from a

999
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:49,979
standard that is globalized and

1000
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:52,499
potentially uniform so I see the

1001
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:58,109
potential that way the decentralized

1002
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,509
blockchain makes it possible to share

1003
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:03,150
data publicly without a single party

1004
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,519
controlling the system in the blockchain

1005
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,890
all participants in the network are

1006
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:12,719
equal maybe inventor Satoshi Nakamoto so

1007
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,420
Bitcoin is just the first experiment

1008
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,910
with this form of digital democracy I

1009
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,430
think blockchain technologies really

1010
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,079
authentically fascinating like I think

1011
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,769
it's anybody who ignores it and in rats

1012
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:30,420
Adolphe is probably making a mistake I

1013
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,890
think it's definitely not going to get

1014
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,180
it it's not going to get smaller but to

1015
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,849
this day the true identity of the

1016
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,799
architect behind this revolutionary

1017
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:45,089
technology remains a mystery you know we

1018
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,859
can't ask the toshi questions which is

1019
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,749
really frustrating right but it's also

1020
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:50,339
again part of I think the magic of

1021
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,440
Bitcoin is that you know we can all kind

1022
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,039
of imagine this technology you know for

1023
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:58,440
you know as we see it rather than just

1024
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,690
as Satoshi did so it could be used in

1025
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,459
this way even if Satoshi didn't intend

1026
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:04,849
it to intend it to be this widely

1027
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:07,709
worldwide distributed thing I think I

1028
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:10,199
think Satoshi probably did but you know

1029
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:12,690
it still could be that and we can we can

1030
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,999
make it that Satoshi around here

1031
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,140
somewhere in Tokyo

1032
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,769
yeah I think I see him right there oh

1033
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:20,880
that's a question I get a lot actually

1034
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,989
um a lot of people have asked me who

1035
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:27,719
Satoshi is since I got in so early um I

1036
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:29,459
think I've got a pretty good idea but I

1037
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,019
like to keep that one close to my chest

1038
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:36,089
so why um because I'm not a hundred

1039
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:37,829
percent certain and the reality is it

1040
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:39,359
doesn't really matter right it doesn't

1041
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,329
matter who Satoshi is because now it's

1042
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:44,729
kind of grown beyond like a pet project

1043
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:47,490
right but I mean Satoshi

1044
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,020
how much how many coins I think these

1045
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,710
got about 500,000 locked up with his

1046
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,560
blockchain technology inventor Satoshi

1047
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,290
Nakamoto has completely relinquished his

1048
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,590
control of Bitcoin but he does own one

1049
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:05,250
twentieth of all bitcoins himself so if

1050
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,650
one day Bitcoin does become widely

1051
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,070
accepted as a currency he will be one of

1052
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,030
the richest people on earth people might

1053
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,970
find that scary a new currency or system

1054
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,430
based on an inventor who owns already

1055
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,140
well one twentieth of all the currency

1056
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,560
invented yeah isn't that a problem

1057
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,750
Satoshi invented one of the most

1058
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,610
important inventions in the entire

1059
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,380
history of humankind that's going to

1060
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,510
improve the lives of everybody on the

1061
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,610
planet for the better if he had half of

1062
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,170
all the bitcoins he would still deserve

1063
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:45,360
it who do you think Satoshi is I think

1064
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
it's probably a band of people who

1065
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,860
decided that a nom de plume was the best

1066
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,530
way to go precisely because if it did

1067
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,140
take off there would be too many

1068
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,680
consequences for a individual one person

1069
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,650
or even a group of people and from my

1070
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,510
perspective you never make a move of

1071
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,030
this sort without a myth you need a sort

1072
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,950
of foundation myth every good sort of

1073
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,380
system of power has a foundation myth

1074
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,140
and it's always best if there if the

1075
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,080
leader is either anonymous or aloof or

1076
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,750
in some way distant from the public

1077
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,460
because you have to create a sort of

1078
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,850
mythology around him and because Satoshi

1079
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,190
nobody knows he is

1080
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,829
some University if we knew who he was it

1081
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,450
would almost it would almost ruin the

1082
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,400
whole thing for everybody I think

1083
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,760
why don't you disappear anything ah he

1084
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,099
undermined the ability of every single

1085
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,510
government on the entire planet to

1086
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,460
control the money supply and that's how

1087
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,680
every single government in the world is

1088
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,030
controlling their citizens and their

1089
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,390
economies today and he just basically

1090
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,650
you know knocked their feet right out

1091
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,730
from under them with the invention of

1092
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,890
Bitcoin and I'm sure that's going to

1093
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,569
make a lot of people who want to control

1094
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:54,589
other people by force

1095
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:56,690
I'm really really upset so yeah I think

1096
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,339
it's really really smart for him to have

1097
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:01,400
a disappeared and for me it probably

1098
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,569
would have been smarter for me to keep

1099
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,880
quiet - but bitcoins too exciting for me

1100
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,349
to just stay quiet about

1101
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,740
I think a lot of people are under

1102
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,500
estimating the way in which Bitcoin and

1103
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,900
the blockchain are going to change the

1104
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,060
power structures in society in general

1105
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,800
I'm and I grew up in the US and uh

1106
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,900
I see all these people like yeah nuke

1107
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,730
everybody in the Middle East and kill

1108
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,350
them all and then they have the former

1109
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,210
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on

1110
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,460
60 minutes one of the most popular news

1111
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,500
shows in the US and they asked her they

1112
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,450
said like there's reports that more than

1113
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,640
half a million Iraqi children have died

1114
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,550
as a direct result of US sanctions and

1115
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,620
she looks back at her with a straight

1116
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,260
face and she goes it was a really tough

1117
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,810
decision but I think that it was worth

1118
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:47,260
it

1119
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,130
worth murdering half a million kids

1120
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,570
because of what the government did and I

1121
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,940
apologized for crying but it just

1122
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,850
disgusts me from my core when I see

1123
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,830
government people murdering people

1124
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,570
around the world it's not just

1125
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,610
theoretical these were real people with

1126
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,630
real lives

1127
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,200
and it's real people and bitcoin has the

1128
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,930
power to undermine everything they're

1129
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,520
doing to people around the world and I'm

1130
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,950
sorry for shouting but it just disgusts

1131
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,440
me what these people in government - and

1132
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,360
they do it through central banking and

1133
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,590
through the control of the money supply

1134
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,990
and Bitcoin takes that away from them

1135
00:48:36,120 --> 00:00:00,000
you
